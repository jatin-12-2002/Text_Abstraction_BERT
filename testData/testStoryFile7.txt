I often order this product to give to others.  This is a GREAT gift!  Everyone to whom I have gioven this product as a present really enjoys it.  This is more special becuase anyone can give chocolate.  This is different and cannot be purchased at regular stores in many states.
I love liquor-filled chocolates.  I received these as a gift and found the gel-like liquor not to be very strong.  It was almost as if the liquor had been cut with sweet syrup and all the alcohol cooked out. A young child wouldn't even get a buzz from these.  The chocolate itself was OK -- better than Hershey's and Nestle but not as good as Godiva or Lindt.
I meant to order Anthony Berg's chocolates and got this one by mistake...yikes, not a good outcome.  The chocolate is poor and the gel-like liquor is worse...don't make the mistake that i made...
Very much satisfied! The box of chocolate arrived just in time for the party. Everyone enjoyed them so much that I am putting in another order for new years.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KJRF40">Very Special Liquor Filled Chocolates 48 Count Christmas Holiday Gift Box Chocolate Gift Pack</a>
This is a very unique gift for anyone.  Chocolate is very good and the presentation is great.  Great to take to a Xmas Party to give the host.  Eveyone will be fighting to get to try a few.  And with 48 in the box it will go pretty far.  It is not strong but you get great flavor of the liquor filling.
I brought this for my co-workers for Valentine's day, they loved it, rave reviews.  I was really good and I would purchase and plan to purchase them again.
I bought this as a gift.  He liked it very much.<br />It came in good condition and good time.<br />I rate it AAAA++++
You know how the chocolate turns light brown when it gets old? That's how these were at the top. They were that lighter shade of brown as if they were old. That part just didn't taste right, but the liquor inside was good. These candies weren't fresh.
Sent this to my brother in Seattle and he loved them. Good flavors, great tasting chocolate, they were well received. Cheers!
This product is great. I have never tried any liquor filled chocolate candies/chocolates but I got to say, these were a great little surprise. I am not good at describing food or candy, but these were little bottle shapped chocolates that are filled with liquid, which is nicely mixed with liquor. Some of these were stronger than others in a sense that some of them you can really feel instantly, while others you only taste chocolate.<br /><br />I shared these with my friends and they seem really happy when they tried it. There are four different chocolates. I would definitely recommend this to everybody. You just have to be careful, these chocolates have liquor in them so use at caution. Great little gift...for myself :)
