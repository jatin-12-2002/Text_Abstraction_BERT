purchased them for as a special gift for a boat christening.  They REALLY enjoyed and appreciated receiving this unusual gift.  Received the item in good shape and quickly.  very pleased with everything. Will order from them again...
Gave this as a gift to my Dad and my boyfriends Dad for Christmas this year. They look great and i got to taste a few myself and i loved them they were so tasty and the alcohol was very real tasting. It was a good buy.
I bought this as a gift for Xmas for my best friend, whom loves chocolate  and loves liquor as well. When she opened her gift to find this, she shined the only cheese smile and said " you know me so well". She couldn't wait to try  them. According to her the Jim Beam is the strongest and the Remy Martin least strongest if I'm not mistaken. They are great tasting and the filling is a gel consistence and the chocolate great as well. Only thing i didn't like was the dents on the packaging, noting really to complain about or call the company about cause my best friend loved it either way.These chocolate liquor bottles are a great gift for anyone who loves chocolate and liquor and don't mind them together.
I sent this to my sister as a gift for the holidays and New Years Eve and the review from her was that she and all the guests at her house loved these before and after dinner liquor filled chocolates...... Nice gift to be shared with many people.
Super Fast Shipping! I haven't tried the chocolates yet, but will at Christmas and leave another review then. But the chocolates came in excellent condition and just like pictured. I followed advise on another comment - to go to the company website and save a few bucks. Thank You!
The liquor filled chocolates arrived in perfect condition and were securely but attractively packaged. i am unable to comment on the flavor as they were purchased for a gift. The secure packaging prevented me from sampling the various flavors.
Delivery of the product was quick, however the items are smaller than how they appear on line. Next time I would order the larger size.
I got these for my boyfriend for Christmas. They are a bit smaller then what i figured they would be from the box, I havent given them to him yet of course but i am sure we will have fun trying them. The box came two day earlier then what amazon said they would come which is nice :)
An otherwise good gum reduced to a three-star review by really mind-boggling packaging. I fail to see the advantage of the foil-covered capsule approach. I lose approximately one piece a pack by pressing just the wrong way and having the gum shoot out of the package like a cannon, forever lost.<br /><br />The gum itself is decent, lasts for slightly less than a twenty five minute car drive, packs a comfortable punch, and improves breath. Still, it's not outstanding, and doesn't overcome the poor packaging, so won't be buying any more.
Fast shipping, items were packaged nicely and are as described. Also, very tasty :) Highly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy.
