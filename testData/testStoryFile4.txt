A great coffee, that is medium roast, not bitter. Yet it tastes as good as it smells. It is also well bagged to maintain optimum freshness.mmmmmmm
This is my second batch of coffee from Jeremiah's Pick. This is good coffee but not as good as their Foglifter. However, it you like a mild yet tasteful coffee, you will like this. I prefer a bit stronger brew though hence my preference for the Foglifter.
The Jeremiah's 5lb bag of Ethiopian coffee is often sold-out, so I've been looking for a good roast with similar value. I'm OK with a more medium roast, but this coffee seems more mild then I would have expected. Still a good deal, but I wish it had more flavor. In general, I've had good luck with Jeremiah's brand, although sometimes the bags are not as well-sealed as they should be.
I liked everything about the transaction, although I am sure that I ordered ground but I received whole bean. I especially liked the price and the speed of delivery.
Cinnamon toast have always been a favorite for me and my family.. Its good and crispy if u dont let it sog in milk to much..<br /> As far as price value its a pretty darn good deal.. i think at costco u can get a similar price for there twin pack according to my aunt but ... i dont have a membership with them so i stick to amazon.. ENJOY.. just keep in mind just as other cereals it has lots of sugars and proccesed carbs so eat wise and stay sharp.
We love this cereal. I purchased this product and everything was great! The cereal was good until Jan. 2012, but of course my family has already eaten the cereal gone in like two weeks. We do eat these as a snack more than anything. I would recommend buying this cereal.
As usual this cereal tastes so good!  The boxes came quickly and timely.  I wish this deal didn't stop!
This is one of the few cereals that I find very tasty just on its own as a snack or as dessert. Crunchy with a  nice cinnamon flavor. It is very sweet, however - I prefer to mix it with something such as Cheerios when eating it for breakfast since the sugar can be overpowering as you get close to the bottom of the bowl.<br /><br />Good value if you can get it on an Amazon price dip and/or when they run a promo.
Love the cinnamon taste but way too sweet. I gave this to my Mother who loves sweets and she said she couldn't eat it either. Need to promote the cinnamin dlavor and cut the sugar
I was crazy about these as a kid! They are tubes simply filled with a flavored powdered candy that has tons of sugar in it. I first tried their cute little wax paper tubes that were about 8 inches long when I was about 7 years old. Goes to figure that my 8 year old is nuts about these now. We used to take our change to the local conveniance store. They came in grape, cherry, and orange, lime and other fruit flavors. Those were very good. But there are also the big 21 inch thick plasitc tubes that hold the equivelant of 20 of the paper ones. This offer gets you a case of 48 packs of 3 tubes each in grape, maui punch, cherry, and orange flavors. Lots of fun from the Willy Wonka factory.
