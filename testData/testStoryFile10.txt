Can't say much about the product itself.  was a gift for friends in California who had just given birth and it arrived 5-6 days after shipping totally melted.  The seller gave early warning before shipping stating the weather had been abnormally hot and that they could not be held responsible for packages missed and left to sit in the heat.  I assumed that was not an issue considering my wife was at their home and aware the package would be arriving and I had also purchased priority shipping (additional $8+dollars).  No such luck.  Be sure whoever you are buying these from gives you absolute specifics before you buy.<br />Just to be fair, I have to say the seller was very quick and courteous with responses to my concerns.  Unfortunately she didn't even consider any form of compensation though.  I really hate throwing money away and giving a less than memorable gift at the same time.
I used to live in Winchester, KY as a kid...  I was actually born and raised there, but moved to Montana in my early 20's...  I moved back to Lexington, KY a while ago and can enjoy this anytime now...  I'm very fortunate in that aspect, but out west it was so hard to be w/o...  Can't say enough about how good this product is...  Very good for mixing w/ some good old Shine or Bourbon...  It's a ginger ale, but nothing like your typical variety...<br /><br />give it a try and see for yourself!!!
Ale 8 is the best thing about Kentucky! It far exceeds any other Ginger Ale product on the market - both because of the delicious taste and because unlike most other Ginger Ale drinks it includes caffeine for that extra shot of energy.
Vanilla beans typically run 6-10 dollars for two at major supermarkets. Those prices make me reluctant to use them in most dishes that call for them, and instead I use vanilla bean paste (Williams and Sonoma sells a very good product). But these beans are such a good deal (less than a fifth the supermarket price) that now I'm willing to use them with almost reckless abandon. Vanilla beans really do provide superior flavor to things like rice pudding and custards and vanilla ice cream, a more complex, more luxurious flavor than vanilla extract does. These beans arrived fresh, fragrant, and tightly bagged. They're Madagascar vanilla beans, considered by some cognoscenti to be inferior to Tahitian beans, but not being one of the cognoscenti, I can't detect much difference at all. This product has made me a fan of internet grocery shopping.
Vanilla beans in our area cost $6 for one and up to $11 for two.  I like to make my own vanilla extract and I also like vanilla flavored sugar which requires whole beans.  I probably have a lifetime supply of vanilla beans now, but with Amazon's excellent price on this item, I can use them freely and order again if I need to.  Thanks Amazon!
I purchased a Cuisinart electric ice cream maker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JGRT">Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice-Cream Maker, White</a>this summer as well as a couple of great recipe books (The Perfect Scoop by David Libovitz, and The Old Fashioned Ice Cream Cookbook by Joyce Deuker). Most of the recipes in each book call for vanilla beans (in fact, almost insist on them!) - have you priced them recently? Yikes. So I turned to my trusty Amazon.com site, searched for vanilla beans and found these. I could not be more pleased - they are moist, flexible and have a very nice flavor. I particularly like that they come in packages of two, so the remainder stay fresh - who knew vanilla beans weren't crunchy! After I have soaked the ice cream mixture, I dry the bean and put it in a jar with sugar so next time I see a recipe for vanilla sugar, I won't have to scramble. I highly recommed this product.
This is a good deal on whole vanilla beans, which I mostly use for making my own extract with Everclear.<br /><br />I stick them in the freezer to preserve, so it's worthwhile buying so many at once and getting the bulk deal on these.
Great product for the price. Only negative would be the packaging. Since I keep mine in the freezer a single package of 24 or 30 or whatever would be sufficient. I make "Chocaluah", a coffee-chocolate liquor for adult use as a syrup over ice cream. These beans add additional depth to the flavor of the sauce.
Purchased for making homemade vanilla ice cream.  Slightly smaller beans than expected, but overall flavor and price outweighs expensive local bought beans.
Nice alternative if you can't find them locally.  Great gift for the avid cook.
