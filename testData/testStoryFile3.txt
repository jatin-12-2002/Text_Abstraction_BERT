I love really good coffee and, in fact, go to great lengths to brew the best i.e. freshly ground beans, purest water, immaculate coffee maker, etc. I have been extremely happy with virtually all of Jeremiah's coffees; and, I have a number of different beans on-hand at all times. The Breakfast Blend is stand-out. Also, try this and their Fogbuster. You will not be disappointed. AAAA++++
An organic coffee for less than $6 a pound (with subscribe and save) with great taste, you can't beat that. This is my only coffee choice for now. I would rather have this than Starbuck's any day of the week.
I have orderred Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Organic Breakfast Blend Whole Bean Coffee more than 5 times however the last lot I received with really bad quality. Lots of broken coffee beans and very oily. Hope the seller can check what happen...I may not try it again.
This coffee is phenomenal for the taste and value. I'm on subscribe and save and this is my daily brew, I typically go though 2 lbs a month or so. This coffee has an excellent flavor and is not bitter or spicy, beats Starbucks breakfast blend hands down.
I was really disappointed in this coffee.  It's a darker roast than i was expecting and the bag has no expiration date.  My coffee tasted quite stale and old.
My senses were surprised by the aroma of the glistening beans as well as the satisfying flavor of the brew.<br />I substituted this bean when Amazon dropped Starbucks Sumatra from their Subscribe & Save program.<br />Now I would never go back.<br />I use a ceramic cone drip filter into a Nissan Thermal Carafe for our brew.<br />For an organic bean, this Breakfast Blend is top of the heap.<br />{{* *}}
This is the best tasting coffee at the most reasonable price for organic! Smooth taste.  Perfect for your morning brew.
You get a fresh, bold, thick flavor from this coffee. Never bitter. I am addicted. I blend it with there decaf at night so that I can sleep. Great price.
This has become our new coffee of choice for the mornings.  It's a good price for a solid cup of organic coffee.  Beans are medium roast and very fragrant.
The organic breakfast blend has an appealing mild flavor. It is very reasonably priced for an organic coffee. I will definitely be buying more in the future!
